# odin-recipes
The aim of this first project is to practice what we've learned about HTML in the foundations course.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
In this project, I will learn to:
- Create basic HTML Boilerplate for an html document.
- Using different tags and elements to create paragraphs, headings, lists, bold text, italisized text...
- Add links and Images to our webpages.
- Writing proper commit messages.
